<h5>Food facts</h5>
									<p>Fresh French beans are an excellent source of dietary fibre, vitamins A, B1, B6, C, antioxidants and lots of minerals. They are also very low in cholesterol, sodium and fat</p>
									<h5>Recipes</h5>
									<p>I only really use recipes as a guide, as for me, it all depends on what you have in the fridge. Use what you have and don’t be afraid of experimenting and substituting things, this can lead to great new ideas and combinations. Learn the techniques and apply them to your cooking!</p>

								    	<li><p>1. Bring a medium sized pan of water to the boil. Add salt (I was taught that beans should be cooked in water as salty as the sea - this seems a lot of salt but gives a great flavour and helps to keep them green)</p></li>

									<ul>
										<li><p>1. Bring a medium sized pan of water to the boil. Add salt.</p></li>
										<li><p>2. Place your beans, cover the pan and cook for 4 minutes, test to make sure they are cooked through but not overdone.</p></li>
										<li><p>3. Remove from the boiling water and place into cold water for a few minutes. This is to stop them cooking (and is called refreshing).</p></li>
										<li><p>4. Place the beans in a bowl along with the other ingredients, toss together and season to taste. If in doubt add less of the seasonings you can always add more…</p></li>
